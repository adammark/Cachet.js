# Cachet.js â€” Local Storage Made Betterer

Cachet.js provides a simple yet robust interface to [Web Storage][1].

## Usage

Include `<script src="cachet.min.js"></script>`.

## Method summary

* Cachet.isSupported()
* Cachet.setItem(key, val [, expires])
* Cachet.setItems(items [, expires])
* Cachet.getItem(key)
* Cachet.getItems(keys)
* Cachet.removeItem(key)
* Cachet.removeItems(keys)
* Cachet.plus(key [, n])
* Cachet.minus(key [, n])
* Cachet.purge()

## Setting items

Cachet.js can store any kind of JSON-serializable value. The method `setItem`
accepts a key and a value. It returns true if the item was saved or false if
the item could not be saved due to a storage limitation:

``` javascript
var user = {
    "name": "Adam Mark"
    "visits": 123
};

if (Cachet.setItem("user", user)) {
    // yay!
}
else {
    // boo!
}
```

Items can be set to expire at a specific time, after a certain number of
minutes, or at the end of a session:

``` javascript
// expire at 12:00 AM on January 1
Cachet.setItem("articles", articles, new Date(2014, 0, 1));

// expire in 60 minutes
Cachet.setItem("articles", articles, 60);

// expire at the end of the browser session
Cachet.setItem("articles", articles, "session");
```

You can save multiple items at once. The method `setItems` accepts an object
with keys and values:

``` javascript
var items = {
    "userId": "12345"
    "userName" : "adam.bomb"
};

if (Cachet.setItems(items)) {
    // all items were saved
}
```

As with `setItem`, you can apply an expiration policy:

``` javascript
// expire all items in 24 hours
Cachet.setItems(items, 24 * 60);
```

## Getting items

The method `getItem` returns a value for the given key:

``` javascript
var user = Cachet.getItem("user");
```

Unlike Local Storage, `getItem` returns undefined if no item was found in the
cache (allowing you to save items with null values), **or if the item is
expired**:

``` javascript
var color = Cachet.getItem("color");

if (color === undefined) {
    // item was never set, or it expired
}
```

You can also get multiple items at once. The method `getItems` accepts an
array of keys and returns an object:

``` javascript
var items = Cachet.getItems(["fruits", "vegetables"]);

if (item.fruits.indexOf("apple") > -1) {
    // chomp
}
```

## Removing Items

You can remove items from the cache individually or in batches. To remove a
single item:

``` javascript
if (Cachet.removeItem("user")) {
    // item was removed
}
```

To remove multiple items, pass an array of keys:

``` javascript
if (Cachet.removeItems(["fruits", "vegetables"])) {
    // all items were removed
}
```

Expired items remain in the cache until you purge them. To purge expired
items from the cache:

``` javascript
Cachet.purge();
```

## Global counters

You can maintain global counters across sessions with the methods `plus` and
`minus`:

``` javascript
visits = Cachet.plus("visits"); // 1
visits = Cachet.plus("visits"); // 2
visits = Cachet.plus("visits", 10); // 12

visits = Cachet.minus("visits"); // 11
visits = Cachet.minus("visits", 10); // 1
```

*It is not necessary to call setItem() before calling plus() or minus().*

## Testing for support

Cachet.js depends on [Web Storage][1]. To test for support:

``` javascript
if (Cachet.isSupported()) {
    // yeehaw
}
```
